# Calculate the recyclability of the product

## Product hierarchy level:
Product top level

## Description:
This task will involve calculating the recyclability of a product based on its materials, components, and manufacturing processes. The goal is to assess the potential for the product to be recycled or reused and identify any potential challenges or issues that could affect its recyclability. The results of this task will be used to inform decisions about the product's design and materials in order to maximize its recyclability.

## Example:
1. Gather all relevant information about the product, such as materials, components, and manufacturing processes.

2. Analyze the materials used in the product to determine which ones are recyclable and which ones are not.

3. Identify potential challenges or issues that could affect the recyclability of the product, such as materials that are not easily separable or components that are not compatible with recycling processes.

4. Calculate the recyclability of the product by taking into account the materials used, components, and manufacturing processes.

5. Make recommendations for improving the product's recyclability based on the analysis.
