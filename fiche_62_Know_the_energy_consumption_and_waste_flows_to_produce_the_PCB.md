# Know the energy consumption and waste flows to produce the PCB

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project aims to analyze the energy consumption and waste flows related to the production of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The goal is to identify areas for improvement in the production process to reduce energy consumption and waste. Data will be collected from the PCB production process and analyzed to determine the energy usage and waste flows associated with the production. Possible solutions to reduce energy consumption and waste will be identified and recommended for implementation.

## Example:
This project will use data from the PCB production process to analyze energy consumption and waste flows. The data will be collected and analyzed to determine the energy usage and waste flows associated with the production. Possible solutions to reduce energy consumption and waste will be identified and recommended for implementation. The project will also consider the potential environmental and economic impacts of the proposed solutions. The results of the project will be used to inform decisions about how to improve the efficiency of PCB production.
