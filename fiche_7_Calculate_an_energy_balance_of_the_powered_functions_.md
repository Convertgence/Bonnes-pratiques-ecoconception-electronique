# Calculate an energy balance of the powered functions 

## Description:
This project involves calculating an energy balance of the powered functions of an electronic sub-assembly. The goal is to ensure that the sub-assembly is powered appropriately and efficiently. The energy balance should include all energy sources, such as batteries, solar cells, or transformers. The power and energy consumption of each component should be calculated and compared to the total power and energy requirements of the sub-assembly. The energy balance should also take into account energy losses due to heat, friction, and other factors. The results of the analysis should be used to make recommendations for improving the efficiency of the sub-assembly.

## Exemple:
1. Analyze the power and energy requirements of the sub-assembly. 
2. Identify all energy sources and calculate their power and energy outputs. 
3. Calculate energy losses due to heat, friction, and other factors. 
4. Compare the total power and energy outputs of the energy sources to the total power and energy requirements of the sub-assembly. 
5. Make recommendations for improving the efficiency of the sub-assembly.
