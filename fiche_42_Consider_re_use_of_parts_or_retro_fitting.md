# Consider re-use of parts or retro-fitting

## Description:
When creating a new sub-assembly for a mechanic system, it is important to consider re-using existing parts or retro-fitting new parts to existing systems. This can help to reduce costs, reduce waste, and increase efficiency. By re-using existing parts or retro-fitting new ones, the engineer can minimize the number of parts needed to build the sub-assembly. Additionally, by considering the existing parts already in place, the engineer can develop a design that is more compatible with the existing system. This can help to improve the reliability and performance of the new sub-assembly.

## Exemple:
When building a new transmission system for a car, it is important to consider re-using existing parts or retro-fitting new parts to existing systems. This can allow the engineer to reduce costs by using existing parts when possible and reduce waste by using existing parts instead of new parts. Additionally, by considering the existing parts already in place, the engineer can develop a design that is more compatible with the existing system. This will help to improve the reliability and performance of the new transmission system.
