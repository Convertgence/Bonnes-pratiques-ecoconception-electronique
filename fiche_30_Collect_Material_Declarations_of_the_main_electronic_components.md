# Collect Material Declarations of the main electronic components

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project involves collecting Material Declarations (MDs) for all of the main electronic components used in the electronic sub-assembly. The MDs will include information such as the chemical composition of the components, as well as any hazardous substances present. All MDs should meet the requirements of the applicable standards and regulations.

## Example:
1. Research and identify all of the main electronic components used in the electronic sub-assembly.
2. Obtain the Material Declarations from the component suppliers.
3. Verify that the Material Declarations meet the requirements of the applicable standards and regulations.
4. Record the information contained in the Material Declarations into a database.
5. Ensure the accuracy and completeness of the Material Declarations in the database.
6. Update the database as necessary to reflect changes to the Material Declarations.
