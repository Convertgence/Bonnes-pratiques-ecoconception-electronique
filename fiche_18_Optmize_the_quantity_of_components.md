# Optmize the quantity of components

## Description:
This project seeks to optimize the quantity of components used in an electronic sub-assembly. The goal is to reduce the number of components while ensuring the same level of performance. The project will involve conducting research, analyzing data, and exploring new strategies for component reduction. Solutions will be tested and evaluated to determine their effectiveness. Finally, recommendations will be made on the most efficient and cost-effective methods for reducing component count.
