# Integrate a product traceability mechanism to follow it during its life cycle

## Product hierarchy level:
Product top level

## Description:
This project aims to implement a traceability mechanism to track the life cycle of a product from its production to its final consumption. The traceability system should be integrated into the existing production process and provide real-time monitoring of the product and its components. It should also be able to track the product’s route from the factory to the customer. The system should be able to generate comprehensive reports including product history, production processes, and any other relevant data. Additionally, the system should be able to alert stakeholders in the event of any deviations from the expected production process or product quality.

## Example:
This project aims to integrate a product traceability system into the existing manufacturing and distribution process, providing real-time monitoring of the product and its components. It will track the product during its entire life cycle, from production to final consumption. The system will generate comprehensive reports, including product history, production processes, and any other relevant data. Additionally, the system will be able to alert stakeholders in the event of any deviations from the expected production process or product quality. Furthermore, the system will be able to track the product’s route from the factory to the customer. The ultimate goal of this project is to ensure that all stakeholders have access to the most up-to-date information regarding the product’s status throughout its life cycle.
