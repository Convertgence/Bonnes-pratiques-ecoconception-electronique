## Description:
Adopting the circular economy in the business model of electronics companies implies a paradigm shift that integrates sustainability principles throughout the product life cycle. This makes it possible to question the company's marketing positioning and identify new strategic opportunities. By activating “circularity” levers in their business model, electronics companies can not only reduce their environmental impact, but also create long-term value for their brand and their stakeholders, including their customers, by promoting innovation, sustainability and resilience.

## Exemple:
The company can adopt ecodesign, the principles of the functional economy (sale of a use rather than a good), take-back and refurbishment programs, collection initiatives for its products at the end of life. It can also consider operating a digital platform (marketplace) for the purchase and sale of its used electronic products, etc.
