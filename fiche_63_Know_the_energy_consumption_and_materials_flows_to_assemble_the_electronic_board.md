# Know the energy consumption and materials flows to assemble the electronic board

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project focuses on understanding the energy consumption and materials flows associated with the assembly of an electronic board. The project aims to identify the key components of energy consumption and materials flows, and to develop strategies to reduce their negative environmental impact. The project will involve analyzing the energy and material inputs associated with each production step, from raw material procurement to the assembly of the board. An assessment of the environmental impact associated with each step will also be undertaken. The results of this project will provide information to optimize the assembly process and ensure the environmental sustainability of the production process.

## Example:
This research project seeks to understand the energy consumption and materials flows associated with the assembly of an electronic board. By analyzing the energy and material inputs associated with each production step, from raw material procurement to the assembly of the board, the project will identify the key components of energy consumption and materials flows. An assessment of the environmental impact associated with each step will also be undertaken. The results of this project will provide information to optimize the assembly process and ensure the environmental sustainability of the production process. The project will bring together experts from a range of disciplines, including engineering, materials science, and environmental science, to develop strategies to reduce the negative environmental impact associated with this production process.
