# Optimize the dimensions of the Printed Circuit Board

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project aims to optimize the dimensions of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for an electronic sub-assembly. The goal is to create a PCB that is cost-effective and meets the performance requirements of the sub-assembly. The project will involve research and analysis of the available components, design of the PCB layout, testing of the design, and validation of the results. The team will also develop strategies to reduce manufacturing costs and improve product performance. Finally, the team will document the project results and present them to stakeholders.
