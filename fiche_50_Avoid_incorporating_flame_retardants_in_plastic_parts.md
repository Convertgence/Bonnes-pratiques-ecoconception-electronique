# Avoid incorporating flame retardants in plastic parts

## Description:
This project aims to identify ways to avoid incorporating flame retardants into plastic parts used in mechanical sub-assemblies. The project will research viable alternatives to flame retardants, review current standards for flame retardants, and assess potential risks associated with using flame retardants. The goal of the project is to develop a strategy to reduce or eliminate the use of flame retardants in plastic parts.

Avoid Incorporating Flame Retardants in Plastic Parts

This project aims to identify ways to reduce or eliminate the use of flame retardants in plastic parts used in mechanical sub-assemblies. The project will research viable alternatives to flame retardants, review current standards for flame retardants, and assess potential risks associated with using flame retardants. The goal of the project is to develop a strategy to help manufacturers avoid incorporating flame retardants into plastic parts. Our research will include examining existing flame retardant-free alternatives, exploring innovative technologies that could replace the need for flame retardants, and evaluating the environmental and health impacts of using flame retardants. The project will culminate in a comprehensive report outlining our findings and providing recommendations for avoiding the use of flame retardants in plastic parts.
