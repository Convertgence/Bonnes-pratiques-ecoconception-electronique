# Reduce the volume of packaging parts

## Product hierarchy level:
Product packaging

## Description:
This project aims to reduce the volume of the packaging parts used for our products. We will explore different options to reduce the volume of the packaging parts while still ensuring that the product is adequately protected during shipping. We will also look into ways of using less material, such as using lighter weight materials, while still maintaining the necessary product protection. Finally, we will assess the cost savings that could be achieved from reducing the volume of the packaging parts.

## Example:
This project seeks to reduce the volume of packaging parts used in our products. We will examine the current materials used and explore different options for reducing the volume of these components while still providing adequate protection during shipping. We will investigate the use of lighter materials to reduce the overall weight of the packaging material, and assess the cost savings that could be achieved from reducing the volume of packaging parts. Ultimately, we hope to find ways to reduce the amount of packaging materials used while still protecting the products.
