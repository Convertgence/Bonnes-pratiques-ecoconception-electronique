# Consider re-use of parts or retro-fitting

## Product hierarchy level:
Electric sub-assembly

## Description:
The use of parts or components that have been previously used in other assemblies or systems can be considered as an option for electric sub-assemblies. Re-using parts or components that have already been developed can help reduce the cost of the assembly, while also reducing the amount of resources needed to produce a new part or component from scratch. Additionally, retro-fitting existing parts or components to fit the requirements of the new sub-assembly can be an effective way to reduce the cost and resources needed to produce the assembly.

## Example:
At XYZ Manufacturing, the team was tasked with creating a new electric sub-assembly. After researching their options, they decided to explore the possibility of re-using parts or components that had already been developed by other teams. After examining the existing parts, they determined that several of them could be retro-fitted to meet the requirements of the new assembly. This allowed the team to reduce the cost of the project and saved them resources in terms of production time and materials.
