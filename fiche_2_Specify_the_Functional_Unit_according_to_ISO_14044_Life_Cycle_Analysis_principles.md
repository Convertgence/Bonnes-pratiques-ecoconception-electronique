# Specify the Functional Unit according to ISO 14044 Life Cycle Analysis principles

## Description:
The functional unit is a requirement of the ISO 14044 standard when carrying out a life cycle analysis (LCA). In ecodesign, the formalization of the functional unit is recommended because it questions the functions of the electronic product to be designed. The functional unit can be considered to be part of the specification phase, because it defines the main function that the product is expected to fulfill over its entire life cycle. It makes it possible to standardize the comparison of environmental impacts between different products.

## Exemple:
For a connected electronic sensor for monitoring indoor air quality, the functional unit can be written: "Measure in real time the air quality of a room corresponding to 15 mÂ² and upload the information every the 10 minutes to a data server. Analyze performance weekly via a consultation terminal. Provide service for 10 years".
