# Design parts that are easily separable by non-permanent fasteners

## Product hierarchy level:
Mechanic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project involves designing parts that can be easily separated using non-permanent fasteners such as screws, rivets, and/or bolts. The parts should be designed such that they can be quickly and easily assembled and disassembled without the use of specialized tools. The parts must be reliable and able to withstand the stresses of the assembly process. Additionally, the fastening system must be designed in such a way that it does not cause any unwanted effects on the parts, such as deformation or corrosion. The design should be optimized to reduce the time required for assembly and disassembly.

## Example:
This project involves designing components for a product that can be easily separated using non-permanent fasteners such as screws, rivets, and/or bolts. The components must be designed in such a way that they can be quickly and easily assembled and disassembled without the use of specialized tools. The components must be designed to withstand the forces of the assembly process and be reliable. The fastening system must be designed in such a way that it does not cause any unwanted effects on the components, such as deformation or corrosion. The design should be optimized to reduce the time required for assembly and disassembly. The components should be designed using CAD software and prototyped to ensure proper fit and function. The parts should be tested for strength, durability, and reliability before being mass-produced.
