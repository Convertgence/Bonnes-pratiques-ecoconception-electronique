# Control products return flows for waste management

## Product hierarchy level:
Product top level

## Description:
This project focuses on developing a system to control and manage the product return flows for a mechanic sub-assembly. The main goal is to optimize the waste management process, ensuring that all returns are properly disposed of and accounted for. This will involve implementing procedures and systems for tracking the products, collecting data on their condition, and then disposing of them in an environmentally safe manner. The project will also involve creating a system for identifying and tracking defective parts and products, as well as establishing a system for maintaining and reporting on the waste management process. The system will also enable the organization to periodically review and evaluate the waste management process to identify any gaps or areas of improvement.
