# Draw double footprints of "strategic" components in terms of procurement

## Description:
The objective of this task is to create double footprints of "strategic" components for the procurement process. Strategic components are those that are essential to the functioning of the electronic sub-assembly, and the double footprints should be used to identify the best suppliers and ensure that the components can be procured in a timely and cost-effective manner. The footprints will include a detailed analysis of the component's technical specifications, pricing, availability, reliability, and other relevant factors. The results of the analysis should be presented in an organized and easily accessible format.

## Exemple:
1. Technical Specifications:

• Analyze component specifications in terms of size, power, speed, current, voltage, frequency, temperature, etc.

• Identify the component’s performance requirements in terms of accuracy, compatibility, and other relevant factors.

2. Pricing:

• Compare the cost of the component from different suppliers.

• Analyze pricing trends over time to identify any changes in the component’s cost.

• Evaluate pricing in terms of value, quality, and other relevant factors.

3. Availability:

• Determine the availability of the component from different suppliers.

• Evaluate the lead-time for the component to be delivered.

• Assess the supplier’s ability to provide timely delivery of the component.

4. Reliability:

• Analyze the supplier’s track record for quality control.

• Examine the supplier’s return and warranty policies.

• Assess the supplier’s ability to provide reliable and consistent performance.

5. Other Factors:

• Analyze other factors such as customer service, delivery methods, and payment terms
