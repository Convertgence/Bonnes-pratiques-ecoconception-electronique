## Description:
EN 45552 standard provides a general method for assessing the sustainability of energy-related products including electronic equipment. Assessing the sustainability of an energy-related product includes the following criteria:
1. Reliability: It refers to its ability to function correctly and consistently under normal conditions of use. It represents the evaluation of a probability of duration between the first use and the first failure or between two failures. This includes resistance to failure, expected lifespan and robustness to environmental variations.
2. Durability: It concerns the ability of a product to maintain its performance over time, while minimizing its environmental impact. This can include repairability, recyclability, energy consumption, materials used and waste management.
It is recommended to adopt the EN 45552 standard and calculate the sustainability for an existing product. This will allow you to specify a targeted value for the product to be developed.

## Example:
When evaluating the sustainability of an electronic product, you can take into account the reliability with the MTBF rate.
