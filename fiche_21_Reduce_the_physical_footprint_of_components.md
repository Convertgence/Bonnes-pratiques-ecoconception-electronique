# Reduce the physical footprint of components

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project aims to reduce the physical footprint of components in electronic sub-assemblies by optimizing the design and layout of the components. This includes evaluating component placement, analyzing the effects of component compression, and making changes to the overall design that will minimize the space taken up by the components. The goal is to reduce the overall size and weight of the assembly while still maintaining the necessary level of performance.

## Example:
To reduce the physical footprint of components in electronic sub-assemblies, we have implemented a number of design and layout changes. These include evaluating component placement, analyzing the effects of component compaction, and making changes to the overall design to minimize the space taken up by the components. We have also tested various methods of heat dissipation to ensure that the necessary performance level is still met. Finally, we have implemented a system of component optimization to reduce the size and weight of the assembly without sacrificing performance. The results have been promising and have allowed us to reduce the physical footprint of components by up to 30%.
