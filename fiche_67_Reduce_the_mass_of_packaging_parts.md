## Description:
This project aims to reduce the mass of packaging parts used in product packaging. The goal is to reduce the amount of materials used while maintaining the safety and quality of the packaging. The team will investigate the use of new materials, design new parts, and optimize the production process to achieve the desired reduction in mass.

## Example:
This project seeks to reduce the mass of packaging parts used in product packaging. The team will examine various material alternatives, redesign existing parts, and optimize the production process to reduce the amount of material used while still maintaining the safety and quality of the packaging. The project seeks to reduce the environmental impact of product packaging by reducing the amount of material used and thus reducing the amount of waste generated.
