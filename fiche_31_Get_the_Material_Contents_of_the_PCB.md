# Get the Material Contents of the PCB

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project is aimed at developing a system to identify and track the materials used in a printed circuit board (PCB) sub-assembly. The system should be able to determine the exact material content of the PCB, including the types of components, materials used in the components, and the surface area of the components. The system should also be able to track changes in the material content over time. The final system should be able to integrate with existing manufacturing systems to provide accurate and up-to-date information on material content.

## Example:
This project will develop a system that can identify and track the material content of a printed circuit board (PCB) sub-assembly. The system will be able to identify the exact material content of the PCB, including the types of components, materials used in the components, and the surface area of the components. The system will also be able to track changes in the material content over time, and will be able to integrate with existing manufacturing systems to provide accurate and up-to-date information on material content. The system will be developed using a combination of hardware components, software algorithms and machine learning techniques. The final system will be able to provide detailed information about the material content of a PCB, helping to optimize the design and manufacturing process.
