# Evaluate the GHG footprint content of the eBOM

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project will assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of an electronic sub-assembly bill of materials (eBOM). The scope of the project will include a review of the components and materials used in the eBOM and their associated emissions, as well as the emissions associated with the manufacturing and assembly processes. The project will also use life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the total GHG footprint of the eBOM. The project results will be used to inform decisions about the design and materials used in the sub-assembly.

## Example:
This project will provide a comprehensive assessment of the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of an electronic sub-assembly bill of materials (eBOM). By using life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques, the project will analyze the emissions associated with the components and materials used in the eBOM, as well as the emissions associated with the manufacturing and assembly processes. The results of this project will help inform decisions about the design and materials used in the sub-assembly, enabling more sustainable manufacturing practices.
