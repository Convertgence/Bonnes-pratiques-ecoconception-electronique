# Select a suitable display technology with limited environemental footprint

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project focuses on selecting a display technology for an electronic sub-assembly that has a limited environmental footprint. The display must be suitable for the application, cost-effective, and meet the environmental requirements of the project. The selection process will include research on different display technologies, evaluation of their environmental impact, and comparison of their features against the requirements of the project. The final selection will be based on the most suitable display technology that has the lowest environmental impact.

## Example:
Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) display technology is a suitable display technology with a limited environmental footprint. OLEDs have a low power consumption and do not require backlighting, making them energy efficient and reducing their environmental impact. They are also lightweight and thin, making them suitable for use in small form-factor applications. Additionally, OLEDs have excellent image quality and viewing angles, making them a good choice for applications where a high-quality image is required. The cost of OLEDs is also competitive, making them a cost-effective display technology.
