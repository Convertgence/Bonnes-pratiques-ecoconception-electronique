## Product hierarchy level:
Product top level

## Description:
This project will focus on the design of a repairable product. The goal is to create a product that can be easily and efficiently repaired, reducing the need for frequent replacements. The project will involve concept design, prototyping, and testing to ensure the product meets the requirements of a repairable product. The end result should be an effectively designed product that can be quickly and easily repaired.

## Example:
This project will involve creating a new product design that is both repairable and sustainable. The design should include considerations for sustainability such as recyclable materials, minimal energy consumption, and the ability to be reused or recycled. The design should also address repairability, including parts that can be easily removed and replaced, as well as easy access to repairs and maintenance instructions. The design should also feature a modular construction, allowing for easy customization and future upgrades. The project will require concept design, prototyping, and testing to ensure the product meets the requirements of a repairable and sustainable product. The end result should be an effectively designed product that is repairable, sustainable, and customizable.
