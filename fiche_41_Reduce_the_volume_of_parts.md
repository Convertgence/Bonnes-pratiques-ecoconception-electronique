# Reduce the volume of parts

## Product hierarchy level:
Mechanic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project aims to reduce the number of parts needed in a mechanical sub-assembly. By streamlining the design process and using standardized parts, the volume of parts can be reduced while also increasing the efficiency and reliability of the assembly. The project team will identify areas where parts can be streamlined or eliminated, and develop solutions to reduce the total number of parts while maintaining the required performance. They will also review and optimize existing designs, and develop new designs that reduce the number of parts needed. Finally, they will work with suppliers to ensure that the parts needed are available and meet the required specifications.
