# Consider re-use of parts or retro-fitting

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This recommendation proposes the consideration of re-using existing parts or retro-fitting them for use in the electronic sub-assembly. This can be achieved by analyzing the existing parts, determining if they can be used in the current design, and then either re-purposing them or finding compatible parts to fit the design. This can reduce the cost of the sub-assembly by utilizing existing parts, and it can also improve the design by using parts that are already proven and reliable.

## Example:
At Company ABC, we have implemented a policy of re-using or retro-fitting existing parts whenever possible. By analyzing our existing parts and determining if they can be used in our current designs, we have been able to reduce the cost of our electronic sub-assemblies while also ensuring that we are using parts that are reliable and proven. This has allowed us to save money and time while improving the overall quality of our products.
