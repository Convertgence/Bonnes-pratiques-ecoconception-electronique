# Reduce standby consumption (low power modes)

## Description:
This project aims to reduce the standby consumption of an electronic sub-assembly by implementing low power modes. Low power modes are a set of techniques that allow electronic components to consume less power when in an idle or standby state. The goal of this project is to identify those components that require low power modes and to implement them in the sub-assembly. This should result in a reduction in the overall standby consumption of the sub-assembly. The project will involve researching and evaluating existing low power mode technologies, as well as designing and testing the implementation of low power modes in the sub-assembly.

## Exemple:
This project will reduce the standby consumption of an electronic sub-assembly by implementing low power modes. We will research existing low power technologies and evaluate their potential in the sub-assembly. We will then design and test the implementation of the chosen low power modes in the sub-assembly. This should result in a reduction in the overall standby consumption of the sub-assembly. We will also develop a methodology for monitoring the power consumption of the sub-assembly to ensure that our low power modes are effective.
