# Evaluate the GHG footprint content of the mBOM

## Product hierarchy level:
Mechanic sub-assembly

## Description:
The goal of this project is to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint content of a mechanic sub-assembly Bill of Materials (mBOM). This project will involve researching the environmental impacts of each material used in the mBOM and calculating the total GHG footprint of the entire sub-assembly. The final report will include the GHG content of each material and a total GHG footprint for the sub-assembly.

## Example:
This project will involve researching the environmental impact of each material used in the mBOM and calculating the total GHG footprint of the entire sub-assembly. This will include collecting data on the carbon emissions associated with the extraction, processing, transport, and disposal of each material used in the mBOM, as well as any other sources of GHG emissions associated with the mBOM. The data will then be compiled and analyzed to determine the total GHG footprint of the mBOM. The final report will include the GHG content of each material and a total GHG footprint for the sub-assembly, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the GHG footprint content of the mBOM.
