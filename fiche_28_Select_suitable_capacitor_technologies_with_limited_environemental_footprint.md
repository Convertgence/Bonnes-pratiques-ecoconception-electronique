# Select suitable capacitor technologies with limited environemental footprint

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project aims to identify suitable capacitor technologies that have a limited environmental footprint. The scope of the project includes the evaluation of capacitor technologies in terms of their environmental impacts, such as energy consumption, emissions, waste production, and recyclability. The goal is to develop a set of criteria for selecting capacitor technologies that are most suitable for use in electronic sub-assemblies. The research should also consider the cost of production and the availability of materials. The final deliverables will include a report detailing the findings and recommendations for selecting capacitor technologies with limited environmental impacts.

## Example:
This project will review existing capacitor technologies with a focus on their environmental impacts, such as energy consumption, emissions, waste production, and recyclability. It will also consider the cost of production and availability of materials. Through a review of existing literature, the project will identify suitable capacitor technologies with limited environmental footprints. The deliverables will include a report detailing the criteria used for selecting capacitor technologies, the findings, and recommendations for selecting capacitor technologies with limited environmental impacts. A cost-benefit analysis will also be conducted to determine the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly technologies.
