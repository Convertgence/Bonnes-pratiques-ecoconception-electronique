# Identify multiple suppliers for critical components to risk obsolescence

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project aims to identify multiple suppliers for critical components that are at risk of becoming obsolete, in order to ensure continuity of supply for the electronic sub-assembly. The project will involve researching the market to find multiple suppliers for the components, evaluating their capabilities, and negotiating contracts with viable suppliers. The project will also involve monitoring the suppliers to ensure that they are meeting the requirements.

## Example:
1. Research the market to identify multiple suppliers for critical components.
2. Evaluate supplier capabilities, and compare costs and delivery times.
3. Negotiate contracts with viable suppliers and ensure that terms and conditions are mutually beneficial.
4. Monitor suppliers regularly to ensure that they are meeting the requirements.
5. Analyze inventory levels and adjust orders as needed to ensure continuity of supply.
6. Maintain an up-to-date list of suppliers and components for future reference.
