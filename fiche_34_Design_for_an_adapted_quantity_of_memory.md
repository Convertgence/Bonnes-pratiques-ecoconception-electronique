# Design for an adapted quantity of memory

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This design will provide an electronic sub-assembly with the necessary memory for its application. The design will consider the size, speed, type, and quantity of memory needed and will determine the most cost-effective solution. The design will also ensure that the memory fits within the existing physical constraints of the sub-assembly and that the memory can be easily accessed for programming, maintenance, and diagnostics.

## Example:
This design will provide an electronic sub-assembly with the optimal quantity of memory for its application. The design will take into account the size, speed, type, and quantity of memory that the application requires and will provide the most cost-effective solution. The design will also ensure that the memory fits within the existing physical constraints of the sub-assembly and that the memory can be easily accessed for programming, maintenance, and diagnostics. The design will also consider the power requirements of the memory and will ensure that the memory operates at the correct voltage level. Finally, the design will ensure that the memory is adequately protected from external interference and environmental conditions.
