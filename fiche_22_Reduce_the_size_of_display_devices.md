# Reduce the size of display devices

## Description:
This project aims to develop a new electronic sub-assembly that will reduce the size of display devices while maintaining their performance. The goal is to improve the efficiency and usability of display devices by reducing their size. This will be accomplished by using advanced components and technologies to reduce power consumption and optimize the form factor of the device. The project will involve the design and development of a tailored sub-assembly that meets the requirements for size reduction and performance. The project will also involve testing and evaluation of the sub-assembly to ensure that it meets the desired performance specifications.
