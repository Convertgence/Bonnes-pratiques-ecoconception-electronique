# Optimize the use of non-rechargeable cells and batteries

## Product hierarchy level:
Electric sub-assembly

## Description:
This project aims to optimize the use of non-rechargeable cells and batteries in electric sub-assemblies. The goal is to improve the performance of the electric sub-assembly while reducing wastage and cost. The project will involve studying the current usage of cells and batteries and identifying areas for improvement. This includes analyzing the types of cells and batteries used and their usage patterns, evaluating the efficiency of battery charging and discharging, and assessing the impact of design changes on power consumption. The project will also look into ways to minimize wastage and cost, such as finding the most efficient charging and discharging technologies and using advanced power management techniques. Upon completion, the project should provide an improved electric sub-assembly design that will provide greater efficiency and lower cost.
