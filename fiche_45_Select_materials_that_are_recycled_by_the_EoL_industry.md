# Select materials that are recycled by the EoL industry

## Product hierarchy level:
Mechanic sub-assembly

## Description:
This task involves selecting materials that are recycled by the End-of-Life (EoL) industry. Research will be conducted to identify materials that can be recycled and reused for mechanic sub-assembly projects. The research should include an analysis of the environmental impact of these materials, as well as the cost and availability. The selected materials should meet the criteria for both the project requirements and sustainability goals. The results of this task should be presented in a report.

## Example:
Materials that can be recycled and reused for mechanic sub-assembly projects by the End-of-Life (EoL) industry include aluminum, steel, copper, plastic, and glass. The environmental impact of these materials should be considered, as well as their cost and availability. Aluminum is a lightweight, corrosion-resistant material that is widely available and relatively inexpensive. Steel is a durable material that is strong and long-lasting, but it can be costly. Copper is a highly conductive material that is also relatively expensive. Plastic is a lightweight material that is easy to shape and mold, but it is not very durable. Glass is a strong material that is resistant to corrosion, but it is brittle and has a high cost. The selected materials should meet the criteria for both the project requirements and sustainability goals. The results of this research should be presented in a report.
