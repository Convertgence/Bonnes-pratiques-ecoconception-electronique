# Avoid lithium-based technologies

## Description:
This electric sub-assembly should be designed to avoid any lithium-based technologies. Lithium-based technologies have been known to cause safety issues, and their use should be avoided whenever possible. Consider alternative technologies such as lead-acid batteries, nickel metal-hydride batteries, or other types of non-lithium-based batteries. Additionally, any components that use lithium should be avoided, such as lithium-ion capacitors or lithium-ion transistors.

## Exemple:
This electric sub-assembly has been designed to avoid the use of any lithium-based technologies. Lead-acid batteries have been used in lieu of lithium-ion batteries, and nickel metal-hydride batteries have been used instead of lithium-ion capacitors. Additionally, any components that rely on lithium have been avoided, such as lithium-ion transistors. By using alternative technologies, this electric sub-assembly ensures safety and reliability.
