# Select recyclable materials of packaging parts

## Product hierarchy level:
Product packaging

## Description:
This project is about selecting recyclable materials for packaging parts. We want to select materials that are sustainable and environmentally friendly. We will look into the types of materials available and their properties to determine which would be the most suitable for our product packaging. We will also take into consideration the cost and availability of the materials. Finally, we will assess the impact of the materials on the environment and the cost savings associated with their use.

## Example:
In this project, we will be selecting recyclable materials for packaging parts. We will research different types of materials including plastics, paper, cardboard, and metal to determine which would be the most suitable for our product packaging. We will consider the properties of each material in terms of strength, durability, cost, availability, and sustainability. We will also assess the environmental impact of the materials and the cost savings associated with their use. Once the materials have been selected, we will create a plan for implementing the use of these materials in our product packaging.
