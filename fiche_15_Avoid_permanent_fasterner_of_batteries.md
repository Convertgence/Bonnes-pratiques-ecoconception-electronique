# Avoid permanent fasterner of batteries

## Description:
This project aims to create a system that avoids the permanent fastening of batteries in electric sub-assemblies. The system should allow for the easy removal and replacement of batteries and should be able to keep the batteries securely in place even during high-vibration environments. The system should also be able to withstand a wide range of temperatures and other environmental conditions. The solution should be cost effective and easy to implement.

## Example:
This project focuses on creating a battery attachment system that avoids permanent fastening of batteries in electric sub-assemblies. The system should be designed to be cost effective and easy to implement, while being able to provide secure attachment in high-vibration environments and withstand a wide range of temperatures and weather conditions. The system should also allow for the easy removal and replacement of batteries. Potential solutions may include magnetic or mechanical fastening systems, or any other innovative ideas that meet the project's requirements.
