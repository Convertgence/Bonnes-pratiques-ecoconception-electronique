# Limit scrap in manufacturing by optimizing the PCBs panelization

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project aims to reduce scrap and waste in electronic sub-assembly manufacturing by optimizing the panelization of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). The panelization process involves cutting and grouping PCBs into individual production units, with the goal of minimizing production costs. Through the use of advanced algorithms, this project will develop a tool to optimize the panelization process, resulting in improved efficiency and cost savings. The tool will also take into account other factors such as the size, shape, and complexity of the PCBs, as well as any other constraints that may affect the panelization process. The tool will be tested and validated in a production environment to ensure its accuracy and reliability. The results of the project will help manufacturers save both time and money by reducing scrap and waste.

## Example:
