# Select IC packages technology that can be easly desoldered

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project is to select an IC package technology that can be easily desoldered for use in an electronic sub-assembly. The package technology should be cost-effective and should allow for easy rework and repair. Considerations should include the materials used, the package size and structure, the soldering process, and the ease of desoldering. The goal is to ensure that the technology chosen is reliable and can be easily desoldered when needed.

## Example:
For this project, we recommend selecting a surface-mount technology (SMT) package. SMT packages are cost-effective, provide excellent thermal and electrical performance, and are widely used in consumer electronics. In addition, SMT packages are typically smaller than through-hole packages, making them ideal for use in compact sub-assemblies.

For desoldering, we recommend selecting an SMT package with a lead-free solder material. Lead-free solder materials have a lower melting point, which makes them easier to desolder than lead-based solder materials. Additionally, lead-free solder materials are RoHS compliant, making them more environmentally friendly.

Finally, we recommend selecting an SMT package with a gull-wing lead design. This design provides increased surface area for the solder joint, which helps to ensure a strong connection between the package and the printed circuit board. Additionally, the gull-wing design provides better access to the solder joint, making it easier to desolder.
