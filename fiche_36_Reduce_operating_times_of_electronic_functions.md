# Reduce operating times of electronic functions

## Description:
This project seeks to reduce the operating times of electronic functions in an electronic sub-assembly. The goal is to identify methods to optimize the performance of the electronic functions, such as reducing power consumption or increasing the speed of data processing. We will analyze the current design of the assembly, and recommend changes that can improve performance. We will also investigate the use of new technologies or materials that might yield faster performance. Finally, we will assess the costs and benefits of implementing the proposed solutions.

## Exemple:
This project will focus on reducing the operating times of electronic functions in an electronic sub-assembly. We will analyze the current design of the assembly, and recommend changes that can improve performance. We will also investigate the use of new technologies or materials that might yield faster performance. Additionally, we will assess the costs and benefits of implementing the proposed solutions, in order to determine if they are cost-effective and viable. We will then develop and test a prototype of the optimized design in order to evaluate its performance. Finally, we will document our findings and make recommendations on how to best implement the proposed changes.
