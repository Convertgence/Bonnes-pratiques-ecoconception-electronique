# Design daughter boards to promote the upgrade of certain functions

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project aims to design daughter boards to facilitate the upgrade of certain functions in electronic sub-assemblies. The daughter boards will be designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of existing sub-assemblies and create opportunities for new features and functions to be added. The design of the daughter boards will include a detailed evaluation of the current sub-assemblies and components to determine which features can be upgraded and where additional functions can be added. The design will also include the development of schematics, PCB layouts, and other documentation to ensure that the daughter boards can be incorporated into the existing sub-assemblies. Lastly, the design will include the development of test protocols and procedures to ensure the compatibility and functionality of the daughter boards with the existing sub-assemblies.
