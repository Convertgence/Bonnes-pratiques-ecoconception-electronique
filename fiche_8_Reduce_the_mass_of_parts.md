# Reduce the mass of parts

## Product hierarchy level:
Electric sub-assembly

## Description:
This project aims to reduce the mass of parts used in electric sub-assembly. We will use a combination of new materials and improved manufacturing processes to reduce the weight of parts without compromising their structural integrity. We will also analyze the current design of the parts to identify areas where weight can be reduced and develop alternative designs that are lighter. Finally, we will test the new parts to ensure that they meet the necessary quality and performance requirements.

## Example:
The Reduce the Mass of Parts project will use a combination of new materials and improved manufacturing processes to reduce the mass of parts used in electric sub-assembly without compromising their structural integrity. We will analyze the current design of the parts to identify areas for weight reduction, develop alternative designs, and test the new parts to ensure they meet the necessary quality and performance requirements. By utilizing the latest materials and manufacturing techniques, we will be able to reduce the mass of parts, resulting in improved efficiency and performance.
