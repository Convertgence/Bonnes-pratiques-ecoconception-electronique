# Reduce the mass of parts

## Description:
This project aims to reduce the mass of parts used in electric sub-assembly. We will use a combination of new materials and improved manufacturing processes to reduce the weight of parts without compromising their structural integrity. We will also analyze the current design of the parts to identify areas where weight can be reduced and develop alternative designs that are lighter. Finally, we will test the new parts to ensure that they meet the necessary quality and performance requirements.
