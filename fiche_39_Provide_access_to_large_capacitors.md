# Provide access to large capacitors

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project involves providing access to large capacitors, which are essential components in electronic sub-assemblies. The goal is to design a system that allows easy access to the capacitors while providing protection from external elements or accidental damage. The system should be easy to install and maintain. The design should also incorporate safety features to protect personnel and equipment from any potential risks.

## Example:
The proposed system will provide easy access to large capacitors while protecting them from external elements and accidental damage. The system will consist of a series of panels that will be used to house the capacitor and provide a secure, dust-proof environment. The panels will be easy to install and maintain, and will feature safety features such as anti-static and fire-resistant materials. Additionally, the system will include ventilation to ensure the capacitors remain cool and operate at optimal levels. The panels will also be designed to minimize the risk of electric shock and any potential risks to personnel and equipment.
