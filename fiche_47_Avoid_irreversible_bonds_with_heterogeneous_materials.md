# Avoid irreversible bonds with heterogeneous materials

## Product hierarchy level:
Mechanic sub-assembly

## Description:
This document outlines the procedures for avoiding irreversible bonds between heterogeneous materials in a mechanical sub-assembly. It details the steps required for ensuring that the materials can be easily separated in the future, if necessary. It also outlines the types of adhesives and other bonding materials that should be used for maximum bond strength and flexibility, as well as the best methods for testing the bond. Finally, it explains the importance of careful planning and execution in order to minimize the risk of irreversible bonds and achieve a successful assembly.

## Example:
When assembling a mechanical sub-assembly, it is important to avoid irreversible bonds between heterogeneous materials. To ensure that the materials can be easily separated in the future, if necessary, the following steps should be taken:

1. Careful planning should be done to ensure that the best methods and materials are used for maximum bond strength and flexibility.

2. Adhesives, fasteners, and other bonding materials should be selected based on the properties of the materials being joined.

3. Proper surface preparation should be done to ensure a strong and reliable bond.

4. The bond should be tested prior to assembly to ensure that it meets the desired strength and flexibility requirements.

Following these steps will help to minimize the risk of irreversible bonds and ensure a successful assembly.
