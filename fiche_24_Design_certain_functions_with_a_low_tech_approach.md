# Design certain functions with a "low tech" approach

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project seeks to design certain functions of an electronic sub-assembly using a "low tech" approach. The goal is to identify and design a set of components that can be used in place of more advanced electronic components, such as integrated circuits, to achieve the same desired functionality. The team should consider cost, performance, reliability, and scalability when designing the components. Additionally, the team should consider any potential safety or environmental impacts that may arise due to the use of these low tech components. Finally, the team should provide a detailed report on the design and results of the project.

## Example:
The goal of this project is to design certain functions of an electronic sub-assembly using a “low tech” approach. This includes identifying and designing components that can be used in place of more advanced electronic components, such as integrated circuits, to achieve the same desired functionality. The team should consider cost, performance, reliability, and scalability when designing the components. Additionally, the team should consider any potential safety or environmental impacts that may arise due to the use of these low tech components.

The team should begin by researching and analyzing existing “low tech” components that may be used to achieve the desired functionality. The team should also assess the performance, cost, and scalability of these components. Based on this initial analysis, the team should then develop a design for the components to be used. This design should include specific component selections and any other components that may be necessary to integrate the components into the existing sub-assembly.

Once the design is completed, the team should prototype the components and test the design for performance, reliability, and scalability. Based on these results, the team should make any necessary adjustments to the design and/or components. Finally, the team should provide a detailed report on the design
