# Minimize the diversity of plastic resins by favoring recyclable ones

## Product hierarchy level:
Mechanic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project aims to reduce the variety of plastic resins used in the production of sub-assemblies for mechanical parts. To do this, we will look for ways to replace current resins with recyclable ones that are more environmentally friendly. This will require evaluating the properties of various materials to determine which ones are best suited for the intended purpose. Additionally, we will analyze the cost-benefit of using recyclable materials to ensure that the switch is economically feasible. Finally, we will work with manufacturers to identify opportunities to reduce the amount of plastic resins used in the production process.

## Example:
This project seeks to minimize the diversity of plastic resins used in the production of mechanical parts by favoring recyclable materials. We will evaluate the properties of several plastic resins to determine which ones are most suitable for the intended use, analyze the cost-benefit of using recyclable materials, and work with manufacturers to identify opportunities to reduce the amount of plastic resins used in the production process. By doing so, we can help reduce our environmental impact and promote sustainability.
