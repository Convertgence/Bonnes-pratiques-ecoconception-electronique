# Reduce the mass of components

## Product hierarchy level:
Electronic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project aims to develop a process to reduce the mass of components used in electronic sub-assemblies. The process should be cost-effective while meeting the required performance and quality standards. The goal is to lower the mass of components without compromising the overall performance of the sub-assembly. Possible solutions include using lighter material, reducing the size of components, and optimizing the design of the sub-assembly.

## Example:
This project will focus on developing a process for reducing the mass of components used in electronic sub-assemblies. The project team will analyze the current design of the sub-assemblies, identify areas where mass can be reduced, and develop a new design that maintains performance and quality standards while reducing the overall mass of components. Possible solutions include using lighter materials, reducing the size of components, and optimizing the design of the sub-assembly. The project team will also analyze the cost-effectiveness of the proposed solutions to ensure that the process meets the budget constraints of the company. The ultimate goal is to reduce the mass of components without compromising the performance or quality of the sub-assembly.
