# Ease access to the batteries embedded inside the product

## Product hierarchy level:
Electric sub-assembly

## Description:
This project aims to develop a system to make it easier to access the batteries embedded inside the electric sub-assembly product. We will design a new system that will allow users to easily replace the batteries without having to disassemble the entire product. The system will use a combination of mechanical and electrical components to ensure that the batteries can be accessed quickly and efficiently. We will also design a user interface to make it easier to understand and interact with the system. The project goal is to make it easier for users to maintain and replace the batteries embedded inside the product.

## Example:
This project seeks to develop a system to enable easy access to the batteries embedded within an electric sub-assembly product. Through a combination of mechanical and electrical components, the system will make it possible to quickly and efficiently access the batteries. Additionally, a user-friendly interface will be designed to ensure ease of use and understanding. The overall goal is to make it simpler for users to replace and maintain the embedded batteries without having to disassemble the entire product.
