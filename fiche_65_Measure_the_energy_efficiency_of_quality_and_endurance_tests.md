# Measure the energy efficiency of quality and endurance tests

## Product hierarchy level:
Product top level

## Description:
This project aims to measure the energy efficiency of quality and endurance tests on products. We will measure the energy efficiency of the tests by tracking the energy usage of the test machines and comparing it to the performance of the test results. The results will be used to identify areas of improvement to increase the energy efficiency of the tests and reduce energy costs.

## Example:
This project will measure the energy efficiency of quality and endurance tests on products to identify areas of improvement to reduce energy costs. We will track the energy usage of the test machines and compare it to the performance of the test results. By doing this, we can gain insights into how we can increase the energy efficiency of the tests and reduce energy costs. This project will provide valuable data to help companies make informed decisions about their testing processes in order to increase their energy efficiency.
