# Limit waste from the shaping of metal and plastic parts

## Product hierarchy level:
Mechanic sub-assembly

## Description:
This project aims to reduce waste from the shaping of metal and plastic parts for mechanical sub-assemblies. We will investigate ways to improve the efficiency of the shaping process, with the goal of reducing the amount of material waste created. This could involve techniques such as reusing scrap material, designing parts with minimal waste and optimizing the cutting or shaping process. We will also explore options for recycling scrap metal and plastic parts, as well as ways to reduce the size of components to minimize material use. Finally, we will look into ways to reduce labor costs associated with the shaping process.

This project aims to reduce waste from the shaping of metal and plastic parts for mechanical sub-assemblies. We will investigate ways to improve the efficiency of the shaping process, with the goal of reducing the amount of material waste created. This could involve techniques such as reusing scrap material, designing parts with minimal waste and optimizing the cutting or shaping process. We will also explore options for reusing scrap metal and plastic parts, as well as reducing the size of components to minimize material use. Additionally, we will consider potential cost savings through improved labor efficiency in the shaping process. Our goal is to reduce waste and costs while still ensuring the highest quality of metal and plastic components for mechanical sub-assemblies.
